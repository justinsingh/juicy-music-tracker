# juicy-music-tracker

Music tracking website scraping [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/) for new music releases and ranking their popularity with data from the Spotify API.

Python 3 is used to implement the web scraper and data retrieval from the Spotify API. This can be seen in the music_tracker.py file. Front-end is built with JavaScript/HTML/CSS. 

Running this project locally requires a credentials.json file (part of the .gitignore) that contains Spotify API credentials.
